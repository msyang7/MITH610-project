        <head>Wallace Talks at Hopkins Amid Pickets, Supoorters</head>
<p> <roleName>Governor</roleName> <persName xml:id="WALL" ref="https://lccn.loc.gov/n82048664">George C. Wallace</persName> of
<placeName>Alabama</placeName> spoke to an audience which showed mixed emo­tion at <orgName xml:id="JOHNS" ref="https://lccn.loc.gov/nb2018003042">Johns Hopkins University</orgName>
last Saturday. He was a guest of the <orgName>Young Democratic Club</orgName> of <seg corresp="#JOHNS">Hopkins</seg>.</p>

<p>Outside <placeName type="building">Shriver Hall</placeName> where the <seg corresp="#WALL">governor</seg> spoke
before a capacity audience, were some 50 pickets
from <seg corresp="#JOHNS">Hopkins</seg>, <orgName xml:id="GOUCH" ref="https://lccn.loc.gov/n50071767">Goucher</orgName>, and various local or­ganizations.
Some people were handing out
mimeographed attacks on the <seg corresp="#WALL">governor</seg>, and a
pamphlet supporing the civil rights bill.</p>

<p>Inside the auditorium there were more <persName>civil
rights advocates</persName> handing out leaflets that said
<quote>"Let’s greet Wallace in silence,”</quote> and asked the
audience not to applaud, boo, or react in any
way to the <seg corresp="#WALL">governor’s</seg> address.</p>

<p>When <persName ref="#WALL">Governor Wallace</persName> walked out on the
stage, he was greeted by a round of applause
as about half the people there chose to disre­gard the leaflets. His security men were scattered
throughout the auditorium, and reporters from the
local newspapers took their seats in the front
row. Flashbulbs exploded as <seg corresp="#WALL">the govemor</seg> walked
up to the microphone.</p>

<p>The <persName ref="#WALL">governor</persName> opened his speech by stating that
he would like to present <quote>"a different image of
people in my part of the country than what you
read in the local press.”</quote> He first dispelled the
press-created image of the bigoted southerner
by pointing out that his administration has done
more to further the cause of racial equality than
any other administration in <placeName>Alabama</placeName> history.
He added that he had once served on the <orgName>Board
of Directors</orgName> of <orgName xml:id="TUSK" ref="https://lccn.loc.gov/n80036583">Tuskegee Institute</orgName>, the world re­nouned
<seg corresp="#TUSK"><persName ref="#BLK">Negro</persName> college</seg> in <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, and that his
administration has donated over $700,000 to this <seg corresp="#TUSK">private institution</seg>.</p>

<p>His administration had also undertaken the
most far-reaching school building program in the
state’s history, which includes 26 junior colleges
and trade schools for his rapidly industrializing
state: <quote>"By the middle of next year,”</quote> said <persName ref="#WALL">the
governor</persName>, <quote>"every student in <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, regardless
of his race, will be within bus distance of a junior
college or trade school.”</quote></p>

<p>He then began discussing the civil rights bill
( H. R 7152), a bill <persName ref="#WALL">he</persName> described as "the gravest
political issue facing this country in years.” He
quoted two past presidents of the <orgName>American Bar
Association</orgName> who described the bill as <quote>"ten per
cent Civil Rights ninety per cent an extension
of the federal executive power created at the ex­pense of individuals, states, and municipalities.”</quote></p>

<p>He pointed out that he was not here to attack
personalities, but only to debate the issues. He
noted that his opponents have not come out with
any statements on the civil rights bill—the main
issue in the campaign, but instead have resorted
to character-assassination. <quote>"If the civil rights bill
is a good as they say it is,”</quote> asked the <seg corresp="#WALL">governor</seg>,
referring to the bill’s supporters <quote>"why won’t they
face me on statewide television and radio to debate
the issue?”</quote></p>

<p><persName ref="#WALL">He</persName> added that according to the press, any­
body opposed to the bill is a racist, a bigot, is
prqudiced and immoral. <quote>"It’s the bill that’s im­moral,”</quote> said the <seg corresp="#WALL">governor</seg>. <quote>"Whenever the
fed­eral government can tell you who to sell your
house to, and can jail you without a jury trial
if you fail to do what they tell you—that’s
immoral.”</quote></p>
