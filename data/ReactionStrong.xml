<head>Both Pro and Con</head>
<head>Reaction Strong to Wallace</head>
<p>By DIANA MCGEE &amp; DON BURROWS</p>
<p>In response to the question ”What did you th­ink of <persName>Governor Wallace’s</persName> speech?” the students’ answers were
as mixed and varied as was the audience in Cole Field House Tuesday evening.</p>

<p><persName>Robert Hill</persName>, an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said, <quote type="positive">I think he was
great. I wish I could meet him. I believe he is for what America stands for.</quote></p>

<p><persName>David Boston</persName>, also an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>fresh­man</roleName>, felt that <quote type="negative">...
he is a very poor excuse for an American. If democracy is so weak as to accept the principles he proposed, it won’t be long
until democracy disappears completely.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Ernest Kopp</persName>, a <roleName>junior</roleName> in <orgName>Engineering</orgName> said, <quote type="positive">I think he
really answered the questions bluntly and truthfully,</quote> while <persName>David Cole</persName>,
an <orgName>Education</orgName> <roleName>junior</roleName> said, <quote type="negative">I think he twisted and evaded most questions.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Diane Holeman</persName>, a <orgName>BPA</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName> said, <quote type="negative">I thought he was rather
pessimistic and had for­gotten the four children who died in the church.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Ronald Jones</persName>, an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName>, said, <quote type="negative">I think that
his speech was very superficial. He didn’t go deeply into any point The appeal of his speech is the lower, unthinking class.</quote></p>

<p><persName>David Beardmore</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said, <quote type="positive">I thought he
did a good job of presenting his case. It is a case of state’s rights, not the Negro problem. Many people misinterpret the problem.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Carolle Foley</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName>, felt <quote type="negative">He was too stupid for
words,</quote> while <persName>Jim Lawrence</persName>, an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said,
<quote type="positive">He’s great, great. He’s for state’s rights.</quote></p>

<p><orgName>BPA</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName>, <persName>Jim Coll</persName> said, <quote type="positive">I thought he was really good.
He had a lot of facts be­hind what he said,</quote> while <persName>Charles Zitzoff</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName>
<roleName>sophomore</roleName> felt, <quote type="mixed">He was a very eloquent speaker, but he was a flimflam artist.</quote></p>

<p><persName>James Bohar</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>senior</roleName> said, <quote type="mixed">When I went in, I
was dead set against him, but now I feel more positive toward him. He confused state’s rights with the integration issue.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Ed Bell</persName>, a <orgName>BPA</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName> said, <quote type="mixed">It was interesting.
I came to hear what he had to say. Some of it sounded rational and some of it was idiotic.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Skip Collins</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp;S</orgName> <roleName>junior</roleName> stated, <quote type="negative">I thought he
was giving very weak retorts. He appealed mainly to emotion. It was very obvious that he was predjudiced.</quote></p>

<p>An <orgName>Industrial Education</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName>, <persName>Ernest Stanley</persName>, said,
<quote type="neutral">It’s the same thing over and over. I even read some of it in the Tuesday’s Diamond­back.</quote></p>

<p>One <roleName>freshman</roleName> co-ed, who refused to be identified, said, <quote type="neutral">I just wish that everyone would have
let him say what he wanted without in­terrupting.</quote></p>

<p><persName>Felecia Hegamonnley</persName>, an <orgName>Education</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said, <quote type="negative">I don’t like
him too much. He’s not good­ looking.</quote></p>
