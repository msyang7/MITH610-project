    <h1>Of Wallace Said and Unsaid</h1>
    <div id="description"><p><h3>Context</h3></p>
<p>The people of Alabama first elected George C. Wallace governor in 1963. That year he pledged to prevent the federal government from desegregating state schools, and in June of 1963 he kept this pledge by blocking two black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama. This would be the first of several attempts by Wallace to stop the integration of state schools. President Kennedy intervened by federalizing the Alabama National Guard and ordering the troops to enforce the federal mandate to allow black students to enroll at local schools. Following this series of confrontations over integration, Wallace announced his intention to run against Kennedy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1964, and he began a speaking tour of college campuses. As part of the tour, Wallace visited colleges in Maryland including Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

<p><h3>Intentionally Black, Intentionally Digital</h3></p>
<p>The following articles about Wallace’s Maryland speeches appeared in the University of Maryland student newspaper The Diamondback. The first article reports on his appearance at Johns Hopkins University, and the second article captures the response of University of Maryland students to his speech on their campus.</p>

<p>As Rodney G.S. Carter has noted “it is impossible for archives to reflect all aspects and elements of society,” and as a result, the archives often retain the voice of the powerful (216). And, if archives “are filled with voices,” they are also filled with silences (Carter 216). I selected the following articles because of their attention to voices and their attendant silences. As a white, male governor in 1963, Wallace had the power to speak against integration to large audiences. But, what did the students on the campuses where he spoke have to say? More specifically, what did black students say? And, what do we know about students in Alabama? These two articles begin an archival conversation between Wallace, the students he spoke to, and students in Alabama. By highlighting what was said and by creating openings for imagining what might have been said, I hope to “fill the archives with a polyphony of voices” but also be mindful of silences (Carter 233). In the following paragraphs, I explain some of the encoding choices I have made to encourage these voices and suggest possibilities for future work.</p>

<p>For both articles, I have used color and font size to emphasize who is speaking and what is being said. In the encoding, I have noted additional elements, such as organizations and places, but in displaying the articles, I wanted to focus your attention on the voices.</p>

<p>In the first article, “Wallace Talks at Hopkins Amid Pickets, Supporters,” Wallace is the main speaker, and his quotes demonstrate the types of arguments he made during his campus visits. I have encoded other people who were present at the Johns Hopkins speech with the persName element even if they are not named with a proper noun in order to strengthen their presence, and I have encoded their actions as quote to suggest that the podium is not the only place where speech is enacted. For example, I encoded a leaflet’s advice to “greet Wallace in silence” as a quote to preserve the silent sound of protest and, in doing that, also honor the productive possibilities of silence.</p>

<p>The second article, “Both Pro and Con: Reaction Strong to Wallace,” features quotes from UMD students commenting on Wallace’s appearance on the UMD campus. The students have a wide range of reactions to Wallace, and I created a basic interp element that could facilitate future analysis of students’ attitudes towards Wallace and integration. Although the article appears to gather a diversity of opinions by noting the class and major of each student, the reporters do not include the race of each student. In effect, black students are silent in this article. To begin to counter this silence, I encoded each participant in the header, and I also started an initial search of yearbook archives to see if I could find more information about the quoted students. Future efforts could use the list to document findings and work to either give voice to or reflect on the silence of black students in the article.</p>

<p>The second article also provides an invitational gap that could be filled with what Saidiya Hartman calls “critical fabulation”(11), the critical imagining of stories that are not told in the archive. In the article, UMD student Diane Holeman mentions the four black girls who were murdered in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama on September 15, 1963. I have encoded the names of each of the girls in the participant list and highlighted their mention in the text with the persName element. All four girls were old enough to be students in Alabama public schools, and therefore, their mention brings both the voice and silence of Alabama students to the article. Future work could employ critical fabulation to describe the murdered girls’ school experiences and perspective on integration. This narrative could help demonstrate the connection between public discourse and violence against black people by framing the words of Wallace with an act that denied education not through desegregation but through death.</p>
